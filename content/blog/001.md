### Or: Why did I want to start this?

There are variety of reasons why people want to start a blog - I think I simply wanted to try it out. If writing these blog posts suck then I wont force myself to do.

Natural question - what do I want to write about? Well I guess if something is interesting enough I will have an outlet to share.
